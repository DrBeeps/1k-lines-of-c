# 1k-lines-of-c
Small journal of writing one thousand lines of C code every week for... as long as I can.

## Pre-Week 1:
-----------
I only have about two days (it is saturday today), before week 1 of the challenge starts.

Day 1 - Today I will be writing some C code testing linux device drivers, and hopefully if I get to it, some embedded C.
Progress - Almost none, wrote around 80 lines of C, almost all of it got deleted though. The stm32ide is not having a fun time and neither am I.
It is bedtime. See you all on the next day of our journey.
